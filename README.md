## Hi 🤗 this is engineer Miranda

### -> 👩‍🦰 About me
I'm one of those "transitioned into tech from social sciences" type of girl.

Having been organically growing in this area for almost 3 yrs, here lists all the projects I enjoyed doing 💛. I enjoyed doing them for various reasons, sometimes I want to know what that concept is, sometimes I want to know how a thing works, sometimes I just enjoyed the process of doing it. For every project, I have a detailed description in the readme file. I'm trying to display them well.

### -> 🧠 My vision for my GitHub
I think one of the most difficult skills to build when transitioning into tech/engineering/even science is the *curiosity* for creations, simply wondering "how does this work?". And I think the best way to keep this curiosity is to keep doing projects. Thus, I want this place to keep reminding me the spirit and keep recording my growth. : )
